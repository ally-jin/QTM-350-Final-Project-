## Amazon Transcribe 
Amazon Transcribe is a AWS ML service that converts audio speech to text. Our project looks into the accurancy of the transcribe service.
To test the accurancy of Amazon Transcribe, we used songs given different speeds, levels of background noise, and artists' pronunciations. Then, we compared the lyrics transribed by Amazon Transcribed to the actual lyrics.
